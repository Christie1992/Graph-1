#GraphKit 
GraphKit is an elegant data driven framework for managing persistence on iOS. Built on top of CoreData, it extends iOS’ powerful persistent layer while abstracting its complexities. GraphKit has a “save whatever I want and however I want” attitude with powerful and rich APIs that are fun to work with. 

Probably the most exciting feature that GraphKit offers, is the endless relationships that may be made without any setup.
