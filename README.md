![GraphKit](http://graphkit.io/graphkitbanner.png) 
GraphKit is an elegant data driven framework for managing persistence on iOS. Built on top of [CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/cdProgrammingGuide.html) and completely written in [Swift](http://www.apple.com/ca/swift/?cid=wwa-ca-kwg-features-com), it extends iOS’ powerful persistent layer while abstracting its complexities. GraphKit has a “save whatever and however I want” attitude with powerful and rich APIs that are fun to work with. 

Some of the exciting features GraphKit offers, are:

- GraphKit does not use one Singleton and maintains complete synchronicity amongst all GKGraph instances.
- It is completely Data Driven and may drive complex changes in multiple UI components simultaneously, without any view coupling.
- GraphKit is feature rich and allows for analytics to drive dynamic components in your app, giving your users a truly unique experience.

#Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C and now in beta testing for Swift. We recommend using this tool in general. To learn more, visit their website [http://cocoapods.org](http://cocoapods.org/). Setting up GraphKit is simple after learning how to use CocoaPods.
