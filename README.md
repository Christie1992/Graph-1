## GraphKit

GraphKit is a framework for data completely written in Swift that allows you to take advantage of powerful data manipulation in a fraction of the time. GraphKit data structures may be used on their own, or combined with the power of Graph, which is a Graph data store built on CoreData. 

As GraphKit grows, many articles and tutorials will be written to aid in learning how to use this framework efficiently and effectively. 

Some of the immediate **benefits to using GraphKit** are: 

* Time saved from setting up simple and complex CoreData models
* The ability to quickly prototype very complex data relationships
* GraphKit can store practically anything

### Elementary Data Structures

GraphKit is a robust data framework and to get you started the following are some introductory data structures. These structures pack a punch when used effectively on their own, and when combined with the Graph persistence layer, they take on a whole new form. Graph is not discussed in the following sections, so if you are interested in jumping ahead, take a look at **Introduction to Persistence with Graph**.

### Advanced Data Structures

Advanced data structures introduces the core flow of information in GraphKit. MultiTrees and Trees are used extensively in Graph, primarily to expand search and movement of information that create the foundation for predictive analytics, machine learning, and robust data models.

### Introduction to Persistence with Graph

Welcome to the core of GraphKit -- Graph. This is where the magic happens and if you read the initial sections you are in for a treat. If you jumped strait to this section, then welcome to an explosive persistence layer built on Apple's CoreData. In this section you will find a primer to the awesome power of GraphKit.
